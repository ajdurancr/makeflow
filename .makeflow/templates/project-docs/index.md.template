# Project Documentation Index

> **Entry Point**: This file helps AI agents understand where project documentation lives.

## 🏠 Main Documentation Hub

**Location**: `../../docs/README.md`

The main documentation hub contains:
- {{PROJECT_NAME}} overview and mission
- Technology stack information
- Quick start guide
- Core concepts and terminology
- Navigation to all documentation sections

## 📚 Documentation Structure

### Patterns (`../../docs/patterns/`)
Development patterns and best practices for {{PROJECT_NAME}}:
- **[Pattern Name]** → [Brief description of what this pattern does]

*Add links to patterns as they are created*

### Specifications (`../../docs/specs/`)
Technical specifications for features and components:
- **[Feature Name]** → [Brief description of the feature]

*Add links to specifications as features are specified*

### Workflows (`../../docs/workflows/`)
Team processes and development workflows:
- **Documentation Guidelines** → How to add and organize documentation

*Add links to workflows as processes are established*

### Decisions (`../../docs/decisions/`)
Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant technical choices:
- **[NNNN-Decision-Title]** → [Brief description of the decision]

*Add links to ADRs as architectural decisions are made*

## 🤖 AI Agent Quick Reference

### For Implementation Tasks:
Include: `docs/README.md` + `docs/patterns/**` + relevant specs

**Example**: When implementing a new API endpoint, include API patterns and related specs.

### For Understanding Features:
Include: `docs/README.md` + `docs/specs/**` + relevant decisions

**Example**: When understanding how a feature works, include its spec and related architecture decisions.

### For Process Questions:
Include: `docs/README.md` + `docs/workflows/**`

**Example**: When asking about development workflow, include workflow documentation.

### For Complete Context:
Include: `docs/**/*` (everything)

**Example**: When starting work on a new area of the codebase or onboarding.

## 📝 Maintenance Notes

**Last Updated**: {{CURRENT_DATE}}

**Update Triggers**: 
- New top-level documentation sections added
- Major reorganization of `docs/` structure
- New documentation categories created

**Low Maintenance Design**: This index describes WHERE docs live, not their detailed contents. It rarely needs updates unless the documentation structure itself changes.

**Progressive Growth**: Documentation starts minimal and grows organically as:
- Patterns are identified and documented
- Features are specified
- Architectural decisions are made
- Processes are established
