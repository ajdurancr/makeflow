## 🤝 Contributing to Documentation

We follow a **Progressive/README-First** approach:
- Documentation starts simple and grows organically
- New content typically begins in this README
- Extract to separate files when sections exceed ~200 lines
- Create folders only when you have 3+ files of the same type

**How to add documentation**:
See [Documentation Guidelines](./workflows/documentation/guidelines.md)

## 📞 Getting Help

**Questions about features?** Check the specifications in `specs/`

**Questions about implementation?** Review patterns in `patterns/`

**Questions about processes?** See workflows in `workflows/`

**Still have questions?** [Create an issue or ask in team chat]
