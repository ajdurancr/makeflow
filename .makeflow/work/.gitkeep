# This folder is gitignored

Work-in-progress folders are created here during development but not committed.

Example structure:
```
work/
└── feature-name/
    ├── AGENTS.md           # Entry point for AI agents
    ├── spec.md             # Feature specification
    ├── plan.md             # Task plan
    ├── decisions.md        # Design decisions
    └── notes.md            # Development notes
```

When a feature is complete, the work folder is:
1. Summarized
2. Moved to `.makeflow/history/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name/`
3. Deleted (this keeps the repo clean)
