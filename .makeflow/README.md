## Quick Start

### 1. Start a New Feature

```markdown
@ai Use .makeflow/workflows/01-intake/from-ticket.md
Ticket: PROJ-123
```

### 2. The AI Will:
- Validate the ticket
- Create `.makeflow/work/feature-name/`
- Create `AGENTS.md` as the entry point
- Guide you through the workflow

### 3. Track Progress

All work is tracked in `.makeflow/work/feature-name/AGENTS.md`:
- Current phase
- Completed tasks
- Next steps
- Decisions made

### 4. Complete the Feature

```markdown
@ai Use .makeflow/workflows/04-delivery/complete.md
Feature: feature-name
```

The AI will:
- Create a PR
- Summarize all work
- Move summary to `.makeflow/history/`
- Delete the work folder
- Update history INDEX

## Work vs History

### `.makeflow/work/` (COMMITTED - but deleted after completion)
- **Active work in progress**
- **Committed to repo** so cloud AI tools (Codegen, Claude Code) can read it
- Detailed tracking during development
- `AGENTS.md` entry point for AI context
- **MUST be deleted after feature is complete** (keeps repo clean)

### `.makeflow/history/` (committed)
- **Concise summaries only**
- Permanent record of changes
- Links to PRs and commits
- Indexed for easy reference

## Why This Structure?

### No Dates in Work Folders
Work folders use feature names only (not dates) because:
- ❌ Dated folders get stale ("started 2 weeks ago, still working on it")
- ✅ Feature names stay relevant
- ✅ One feature per branch enforced
- ✅ Dates added in history when complete

### Separate Work & History
- **Work folder**: Detailed, evolving, temporary
- **History folder**: Concise, permanent, indexed
- Keeps repo clean while maintaining full traceability

### AGENTS.md as Entry Point
- Single file AI agents can read for full context
- Always up-to-date with current state
- Clear structure for tracking progress
- Easy for humans to review

## Using with Different AI Tools

### Codegen
```markdown
@codegen Use .makeflow/workflows/01-intake/from-ticket.md
Ticket: PROJ-123
```

### Cursor
```markdown
@Cursor Follow the workflow in .makeflow/workflows/01-intake/from-ticket.md

Ticket: PROJ-123
```

### Claude Code
```markdown
@Claude Execute .makeflow/workflows/01-intake/from-ticket.md

Context:
- Ticket: PROJ-123
- Project: [project name]
```

### Any AI Tool
Copy-paste the workflow content and provide context!
