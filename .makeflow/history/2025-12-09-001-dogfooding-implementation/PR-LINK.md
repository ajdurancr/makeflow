## Meta Note

This is makeflow's **first completed work folder**! 🎉

It establishes the "dogfooding" principle: we use makeflow workflows to develop makeflow itself.

The work folder was created, populated, tracked, summarized to history, and **deleted** - demonstrating the complete cycle that all future contributors will follow.
