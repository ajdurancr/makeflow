# makeflow History Index

This file tracks all completed features, changes, and bug fixes.

## How This Works

When a feature is completed using `.makeflow/workflows/04-delivery/complete.md`:

1. The work folder `.makeflow/work/feature-name/` is summarized
2. A concise summary is created in `.makeflow/history/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name/`
3. This INDEX is updated with the entry
4. The work folder is deleted (keeps repo clean)
